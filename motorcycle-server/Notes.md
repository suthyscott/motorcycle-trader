```A module is a class annotated with a @Module() decorator. The @Module() decorator provides metadata that Nest makes use of to organize the application structure.```

Meaning that a module is the same as a JS module in the front end. Just a piece of the overall application. With it's own endpoints and handlers?

Modules should have their own directory.
